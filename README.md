Project Title: "Company Attraction"

Step 1: Data Import and Cleaning Using Excel and Power BI
   - The project commenced with the import of raw data related to the company's various aspects. Leveraging both Excel and Power BI, you meticulously cleaned the data. This involved tasks such as handling duplicates, addressing missing values, and ensuring consistency in data formats to lay a solid foundation for meaningful analysis.

Step 2: Age-Group and Salary Group Creation for Meaningful Insights
   - To extract valuable insights, you strategically organized the workforce data into age groups and salary bands. This categorization allowed for a more granular understanding of the demographics and compensation structures within the company. This step set the stage for targeted analysis and decision-making.

Step 3: Creation of a Visual Dashboard Using Power BI
   - The heart of the project unfolded as you crafted a visually stunning dashboard using Power BI. Employing a variety of chart types such as bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, area charts, and even maps, you presented the data in an accessible and insightful manner. Each chart type was carefully chosen to convey specific aspects of the company's attraction factors.

   - Bar Chart:** Used for clear comparisons of data across different categories.
   - Pie Chart:** Depicted the proportional representation of different factors within a whole.
   - Donut Chart:** A variation of the pie chart, emphasizing data in a ring format.
   - Clustered Bar Chart:** Provided a multi-dimensional view of data, facilitating comparisons.
   - Scatter Chart:** Helped visualize the relationship between two variables.
   - Line Chart:** Displayed trends and patterns over a continuous data set.
   - Area Chart:** Illustrated cumulative data trends, emphasizing the magnitude of change.
   - Slicers:** Enabled interactive filtering, enhancing user engagement.

   - The amalgamation of these visual elements not only made the data interpretation more intuitive but also allowed stakeholders to derive actionable insights efficiently.

The project reflects a comprehensive approach, from data cleaning to insightful categorization and, ultimately, the creation of a powerful dashboard that can serve as a valuable tool for decision-makers within the company.
